# Instagram-Clone

A project to decentralize content moderation using MetaMask. Users logged in via MetaMask can vote on AI-flagged content and earn rewards if their vote matches the majority. The front end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring login, account management, and access control for flagged content.

# Decentralized Social Media Content Voting

This project aims to decentralize the moderation process on social media platforms by allowing users to vote on content flagged by AI. The system is designed to be fair and transparent, giving users the power to influence content moderation decisions.

## Key Features:
- **MetaMask Integration**: Only users who log in through MetaMask can participate in voting on flagged content.
- **Incentivized Voting**: Users are rewarded if their vote aligns with the majority, promoting honest and community-driven moderation.
- **Content Access Control**: Flagged content is restricted to MetaMask users, while regular users can log in but won't have access to the voting system.
- **User Authentication**: Supports both normal login and MetaMask-based login for different user experiences.
- **Front-End Technologies**: The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

## How It Works:
1. **AI-Flagged Content**: Content is automatically flagged by AI based on certain criteria.
2. **Voting Mechanism**: Logged-in MetaMask users can vote on whether the content should remain or be removed.
3. **Incentives**: Users earn rewards for voting in line with the majority, ensuring the community's voice is heard.
4. **Access Control**: Only users authenticated via MetaMask have access to the voting system, while regular users can still browse other features.
